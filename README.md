# My NixOS Config

This is my NixOS config. The backbone (nix/home-manager) is based heavily on Andrey0189's "Reborn" config, with plenty of advice from good friends. I wrote this config with a NVIDIA laptop in mind that I intend to use as a 3D workstation, so there's some weirdness.

The RICE is based off my friend Wyatt's RICE, though modified to fit my own tastes.
