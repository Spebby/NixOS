# My NixOS Config

This is my NixOS config. The backbone (nix/home-manager) is based heavily on
ampersand's "Reborn" config. I've essentially taken that config, and blended it
with my pre-existing dots and quirks I've had from my Gentoo and Arch days. This
setup is made with a Lonovo Legion 5 Pro 16ARH7H in mind, but with some
tinkering it should work on most systems. Plenty of credit due to my good
fiends, [wyatt](www.wyatt.wtf) and [molecule31](https://molecule31.co.ua/) for
helping me through the learning process. This repository will be somewhat active
as long as I'm using this system--I go back and forwards between this and a old
Thinkpad running Gentoo, which I have no intention of moving over to Nix.

The RICE is based off of ampersands, though I intend to change it quite a bit
once the system is mostly stable. Still plenty to be done! Expect actually
pictures here when it no longer looks exactly like ampersands.
