# On Hardware

"Rosso" is a Lonovo Legion 5 Pro 16ARH7H. The nixos-hardware repository hosts
many different pre-configured profiles for different hardware. While the 16ARH7H
does not have a profile, an extremely similar laptop, the 16ACH6H does. I have
chosen to adapt that

## On Specialisations

This config makes use of Specialisations. They do increase idle RAM usage, so if
you'd prefer, pick a single mode and stick to it.
